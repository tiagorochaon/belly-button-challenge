# belly-button-challenge
This challege brings together the index.html file and the app.js file (under the static directory) to visualize data from the belly button biodiversity dataset.  The dashboard is published to github pages here: https://github.com/tiagorochaon/belly-button-challenge
Choose the test subject ID number on the left pane of the page to view the subject's demographic info, top 10 OTUs, and a bubble chart of all the individual's OTUs. Enjoy!
